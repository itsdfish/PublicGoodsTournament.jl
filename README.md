This repo hosts code for a Gladitorial death match between agents who compete in the iterative public goods game.

# Leader Board


# Installation

Install the latest version of [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

You may optionally install the [VSCode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Julia plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia).

First, create a fork of this repo, and install it on your computer by typing the following into the Julia REPL:

```julia 
] dev url_to_your_fork
```
This will install a development copy in `.julia/dev` where you can create your agent. 

# Organization

The folder `src` contains a template associated with your name where you can write your code. A simple example can be found in `src/douche_bag.jl`.

# Documentation

The documentation can be found [here](https://itsdfish.github.io/PublicGoodsTournament.jl/dev/api/).

# Submitting your Agent

As you work on your agent, you can commit changes to your fork optionally from the Julia REPL. Simply type `]` to switch to the terminal mode and use git commands as usual. Once you are ready to submit your agent, submit a pull request to the originating repo. 

# Example

To run a battle against the Guesser agent, copy and modify `douche_bag_vs_douche_bag.jl`.
